# Sudoku-GUI
 
The GUI file allows you to play the actual sudoku game... it needs some tweaks so that you can adjust difficulty, try again, and lose after a certain number of errors, but it is technically functional.

It draws on a randomized game board that is generated in the Sudoku_Generator file.
SudokuGenerator takes in two arguments... 

writing Sudoku(None, #)

The number controls the difficulty... 1 is really easy, and I have pushed it to 10 before...
my computer doesn't like it much after 10...
